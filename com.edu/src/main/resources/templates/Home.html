        <p>
          Computers intersect with every aspect of kids' lives, but most kids
          don't understand how they work. Through coding, students build
          essential literacy skills, gain an understanding of logic and
          sequence, and learn the mechanics of iteration. For beginners and
          those with intermediate skills, there are tons of choices that offer
          instruction, practice, and opportunities to apply skills. Though
          there's definitely overlap between many platforms, the tools for more
          advanced students require some prerequisite foundational skills. Plus,
          there are tools that are totally user-driven -- without teacher
          resources -- to recommend for students who are really motivated.
          Learning through games is a fun entry point, so you can check out some
          of those choices. And if students really want to see a published
          product as the fruit of their coding labor, there are tools that are
          really practical, with direct application of coding skills. If you
          have students who may or may not be into coding but are into other
          forms of self-expression, the tools for creativity beyond coding might
          work well. For tangible teachable moments, check out the tools that
          have hardware components. And older students using mobile devices
          might enjoy coding apps. Using these picks, kids can unlock the logic
          of code and the basics of programming, turning computers into tools to
          make new things.

            Your trusted guide for a fast-changing world.
            Media and technology are at the center of kids' lives every day. From a very young age, kids use technology at home and at school to connect with friends and family and to document their lives and create digital content of their own. With more and more of life happening online, what catches kids' attention isn't always what's best for them, and what companies do with their personal information isn't always clear.
            
            Independent. Nonprofit. Research backed.
            Since 2003, we have been the leading source of entertainment and technology recommendations for families and schools. Every day, millions of parents and educators trust reviews and advice to help them navigate the digital world with their kids. Together with policymakers, industry leaders, and global media partners, we're building a digital world that works better for all kids, their families, and their communities.
            
            Healthy, happy kids—no matter what the future holds.
            Our mission to ensure digital well-being for kids everywhere has never been more vital than it is today. See our story, and read about our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion.</p>
